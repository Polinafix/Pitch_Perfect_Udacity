# Pitch Perfect 

An iPhone app that allows users to record their voice and then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. This app also lets the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback, and experience fun echo and reverb effects.


## Implementation
The app contains two scenes:
1) _RecordSoundsViewController_ for recording an audio file.
Tapping on thw microphone button starts an audio recording session. When the stop button is tapped, the recording completes and takes the user to the next screen.

2) _PlaySoundsViewController_ for playing the audio with different effects.
